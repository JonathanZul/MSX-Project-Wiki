# The Oyster MSX Project Wiki

This repository serves as the central knowledge base for the Oyster MSX Project, a research initiative at the University of Prince Edward Island's School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences.

## Project Abstract

The Eastern oyster aquaculture industry in Atlantic Canada is a vital economic engine, but it faces a persistent threat from the parasite _Haplosporidium nelsoni_ (MSX). The current diagnostic process relies on a slow, expensive, and manual review of histopathology slides by a small number of trained pathologists. This project aims to solve this bottleneck by developing an explainable, AI-powered Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) system to serve as a diagnostic tool. Our ultimate goal is to create a scalable system that supports experts, accelerates diagnosis, and helps protect the region's oyster populations.

## Current Project Status

The foundational Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) annotation system has been successfully implemented. We are currently using this system to build a high-quality annotated dataset while researching and developing the next major phase: the VLM-based diagnostic module.

## How to Navigate This Wiki

This wiki is organized into two main sections. Start with the **Domain Background** for essential context on the biology and diagnostic procedures, then move to **The MSX Project** for details on our technical implementation.

### 1. Domain Background

- [**01_The_Eastern_Oyster.md**](./01_Domain_Background/01_The_Eastern_Oyster.md): An overview of the Eastern oyster's economic and ecological importance.
- [**02_Oyster_Histopathology_101.md**](./01_Domain_Background/02_Oyster_Histopathology_101.md): A guide to the process of creating and analyzing oyster histology slides.
- [**03_Key_Oyster_Anatomy.md**](./01_Domain_Background/03_Key_Oyster_Anatomy.md): A visual reference for the key oyster organs relevant to MSX diagnosis.
- [**04_Oyster_Diseases_Overview.md**](./01_Domain_Background/04_Oyster_Diseases_Overview.md): Information on MSX and other common oyster pathogens.

### 2. The MSX Project

- **[01_The_Annotations_HIL_System](./02_The_MSX_Project/01_The_Annotations_HIL_System/README.md)**: Documentation for the foundational system designed for rapid data annotation.
- **[02_The_VLM_Explainable_Output_System](./02_The_MSX_Project/02_The_VLM_Explainable_Output_System/README.md)**: Documentation for the next-generation system focused on automated diagnosis.
